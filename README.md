# Skin Cancer Detection with CNN ðŸ§ª


## This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks to detect and classify cancer from dermoscopic images. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis by providing an AI-powered model trained on a label dataset

#Project Overview

## Skin cancer is among the most common forms of cancer globally. By utilizing deep learning techniques, particularly CNN, this project aims to automate and improve the accuracy of the inital skin cancer detection. The model was trained on large public image datasets from the HAM10000 dataset Among those images are believe to be a mix of benign and malignant images.
